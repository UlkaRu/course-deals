# Goals

- ping udemy for a certain course using the course url and get it's current listed price
- admin can create a course by adding its course url and affiliate link, script will run and get the rest of the information automatically
- courses listed on home page

## Notes

/ and /courses are the same (for now)
/courses/new is accessible by admin only

Use single database, but have two servers, one for rendering the courses index and another for course creation and scheduled updating of all course prices
